Transmission distortion of Ab10 chromosome

This repository contains the code for analyzing distortion of the Ab10 chromosomal knob from Dawe et al 2018, "A Kinesin-14 Motor Activates Neocentromeres to Promote Meiotic Drive in Maize" ([DOI 10.1016/j.cell.2018.03.009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.03.009)). Both code and data files are provided to generate the data and figures related to this analysis. Code is provided free of charge, without a warranty of any sort, etc.

The genotypes used for this analysis were received from the Genomic Diversity Facility at Cornell University. They were called from genotyping-by-sequencing data using the Tassel5-GBS Production Pipeline using the ZeaGBSv2.7 Production TOPM ([Glaubitz et al. 2014 PLoS ONE 9: e90346](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090346)). Imputation was performed with FILLIN ([Swarts et al. 2014 Plant Genome 7(3)](http://dx.doi.org/10.3835/plantgenome2014.05.0023)), using the "V5" set of donor haplotypes available at [Panzea.org](http://cbsusrv04.tc.cornell.edu/users/panzea/download.aspx?filegroupid=4).
